title: NHTSA Five Star Ratings
---

This dataset of the vehicles tested under NHTSA's 5-star rating system includes their performance, as well as video and photo footage of the crash tests.

The data set is relatively small (10,000 vehicles), but we've collected it from NHTSA's API and stored it on [BigQuery](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/welcome/nhtsa-revs)
